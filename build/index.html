But then the offense sputtered and had four straight punts and a fumble on first five possessions in second half and managed just one touchdown after the break. Still, the defense (eight sacks and two turnovers) and Christian McCaffrey (210 all-purpose yards) bailed out Stanford for a 26-13 win over Kansas State."},{"week":2,"ranking":2,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(1-0) John Ross III for Heisman? Too soon? Maybe so. But the junior receiver/kick returner certainly opened some eyes across the country with a three-touchdown performance (38-yard and 50-yard receptions and 92-yard kickoff return) in his first game back from knee surgeries that forced him to miss 2015. The Huskies are averaging 48.3 points in past three games."},{"week":2,"ranking":3,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(1-0) Looks like it’s going to take Brady Hoke a little longer to revamp a Ducks defense that gave up nearly 400 yards and 28 points at home to a UC Davis team that ranked 11th in scoring and last in yards in the FCS Big Sky last year. Still, freshman linebacker Troy Dye had 11 tackles, including 4.5 for loss en route to winning the conference Defensive Player of the Week honors."},{"week":2,"ranking":4,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(1-0) Utes now own the longest current sellout streak in Pac-12 with 39 straight capacity crowds at Rice-Eccles Stadium. The place will be packed Saturday when in-state rival Brigham Young visits. Utah has a five-game win streak against the Cougars."},{"week":2,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(1-0) Sun Devils make the biggest jump in this week’s rankings (six spots up). Still not sold on Manny Wilkins as a pocket passer, but he’s one heck of a runner who made the highlights with an air-defying hurdle over a defender last week. He had 180 passing yards on 20 of 27 attempts and 89 yards rushing on 14 carries."},{"week":2,"ranking":6,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(0-1) Josh Rosen did some nice things in season opener, but his three interceptions played a large role in the 31-24 loss at Texas A&M. The turnovers are troubling, but the more pressing issue is shoring up an offensive line that allowed five sacks."},{"week":2,"ranking":7,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(1-0) Buffaloes looked impressive last week’s 44-7 romp over Colorado State. It was easily the most-lopsided win against a FBS team in coach Mike MacIntyre’s four-year tenure. There’s plenty to like about Colorado starting with former Bellarmine Prep standout Sefo Liufau who became the school’s all-time passing leader with 7,715 yards."},{"week":2,"ranking":8,"team":"California","blurb":"(1-0) Maybe you forgot about the Golden Bears who opened the season Aug. 27 in Sydney, Australia and had a bye last week. Good thing too because Hawaii, which lost 51-31 to in the opener, got smashed 63-3 at Michigan last week. Cal has had plenty of time to get ready for a tough trip to San Diego State."},{"week":2,"ranking":9,"team":"USC","blurb":"(0-1) Absolutely love the moxie it takes to play No. 1 ranked and defending champion Alabama in Dallas. But you have to show up. Trojans’ 52-6 beatdown is worse loss since 1966 and fourth most lopsided loss in history. USC failed to score a touchdown for first time since 2007."},{"week":2,"ranking":10,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(0-1) It’s such low bar in Corvallis, Ore. considering Beaver fans are strangely optimistic after a 30-23 loss at Minnesota. The reason for that optimism is quarterback Darell Garretson, a transfer from Utah State, who threw for 228 yards and three touchdowns."},{"week":2,"ranking":11,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(0-1) Junior quarterback Anu Solomon might miss Saturday’s home opener with an ankle injury. Even if he plays, he won’t keep the job for long with another performance like last week’s 213-yard and two-interception outing in an 18-16 loss to Brigham Young. If the Wildcats can’t generate get the offense going, expect to see Brandon Dawkins."},{"week":2,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(0-1) Here we go again. Maybe last week’s 45-42 defeat to Eastern Washington is a good omen. Last year, the Cougars lost to FCS division Portland State in the opener and finished 9-4 – its best record since 2003."},{"week":3,"ranking":1,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(2-0) Remember when the passing game was the weakest link for the Huskies? Not this season. At least, not against two over-matched opponents. Jake Browning had 16 passing touchdown in 12 games last year. He already has eight this season (including a bowl game) and is on pace to finish with 52. UW’s defensive starters have surrendered just three points in the first half."},{"week":3,"ranking":2,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"(1-0) Can’t imagine any team in the country has a more difficult schedule (vs. USC, at UCLA, at Washington, vs. Washington State and at Notre Dame) over the next five weeks than the Cardinal. Last week: Bye. "},{"week":3,"ranking":3,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(2-0) In his last outing, Royce Freeman ripped off an 85-yard touchdown run and tallied 207 rushing yards for his 18th 100-yard rushing performance since 2014 – the most for a player from a Power 5 Conference player. He has rushed for at least 100 yards in 10 straight games against FBS opponents."},{"week":3,"ranking":4,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(2-0) The Utes have a special defense, but there’s no way they win another game when the offense commits six turnovers. Quarterback Troy Williams tossed three interceptions and Utah committed six fumbles, losing three."},{"week":3,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(2-0) Can Kalen Ballage play defense? Seriously, the Sun Devils need help stopping people. They rank last in the Pac-12 allowing 518.5 yards per game. Can’t expect Ballage to bail them out each week. Still, he had a special day last Saturday. Ballage had 15 touches and found the end zone eight times to tie a NCAA record with the most touchdowns and points in a game. He scored seven touchdowns on runs of 75, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1 and 1, plus a 39-yard reception. Ballage had 207 all-purpose yards, including 137 rushing. He has nine touchdowns this season, which is more than Stanford (3), Oregon State (3), Utah (5), USC (6), Arizona (6) and UCLA (8)."},{"week":3,"ranking":6,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(2-0) The Buffaloes have scored 100 combined points in the past two games, which is more than they had in the past six games in 2015. Quarterback Sefo Liufau was very efficient with 15-of-18 passing for 204 yards and two TD passes against Idaho State."},{"week":3,"ranking":7,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(1-1) The Bruins rebounded from a tough road loss in the opener at Texas A&M with a satisfying – if not always consistent – 21-point win over UNLV. Josh Rosen threw for 267 yards and one touchdown and rushed for one score. "},{"week":3,"ranking":8,"team":"USC","blurb":"(1-1) Not sure if the Trojans have settled on a quarterback. Max Browne started and tossed two touchdown passes, but backup Sam Darnold also had two TD throws against Utah State. The Trojans also received big games from Adoree Jackson (77-yard punt return for a TD) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (2 TD catches)."},{"week":3,"ranking":9,"team":"California","blurb":"(1-1) New quarterback Davis Webb tossed five TD passes and 522 yards, but sailed a pass high in the final minutes that might have capped an improbable comeback. Still, the Golden Bears lost this game because of its inability to stop Donnel Pumphrey who ran for 3 TDS and 281 yards to break Marshall Faulk’s school record."},{"week":3,"ranking":10,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(1-1) The Wildcats were a 44-point favorite, but trailed 21-7 at halftime against Grambling State. Arizona used a 21-point third quarter to take control of the game. Will be interesting to see if Anu Solomon who sat out due to a knee injury, will start again after his replacement Brandon Dawkins led the comeback with 320 all-purpose yards, 223 passing and 97 rushing."},{"week":3,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(0-1) The Beavers had an extra week to get ready for Idaho State, which lost by 49 points at Colorado. Should be a fun home opener at Reser Stadium on Saturday. "},{"week":3,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(0-2) Second straight week at that bottom of the rankings, which is no way to start a season. Coach Mike Leach was 2-for-5 on fourth-down conversions, which played a big role in Saturday’s loss at Boise State. Questionable clock management in the final minute also undermined a late comeback effort."},{"week":4,"ranking":1,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"(2-0) As if we needed a reminder, but Christian McCaffrey is pretty doggone good. After a week off, the do-everything star accounted for 260 all-purpose yards and 2 TDs in last week’s 27-10 dismantling of USC, which also re-launched his Heisman Trophy campaign."},{"week":4,"ranking":2,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(3-0) The Huskies’ offensive success begins and ends with Jake Browning, who has 744 passing yards, 12 touchdowns and one interception while completing 72 percent of his throws. The Huskies have outscored opponents 148 to 30. UW has scored at least 40 points in the past six games."},{"week":4,"ranking":3,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(3-0) The Utes debuted at No. 24 this week in the Associated Press Top 25. They racked up 10 sacks during last week’s 34-17 win at San Jose State. Senior WR Tim Patrick has given Utah a vertical threat to the passing game. He is 19th in the nation with 285 receiving yards on 14 receptions. Patrick also has all four of Utah’s receiving TDs."},{"week":4,"ranking":4,"team":"California","blurb":"(2-1) The Golden Bears make the biggest jump in this week’s rankings, moving up five spots. Not sure if there’s a Pac-12 quarterback playing better than newcomer Davis Webb. The Texas Tech transfer orchestrated a 50-43 upset win over then-No. 11 Texas with a 396-yard, 4-TD performance."},{"week":4,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(3-0) It hasn’t always been pretty, but the Sun Devils are undefeated. ASU’s pass defense ranks last among the 128 Division I schools, allowing 379.3 yards per game. That might be a problem this week against California, which is second in the nation averaging 453 passing yards per game."},{"week":4,"ranking":6,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(2-1) Held BYU to 23 rushing yards, which his the lowest for a Bruins opponent since 2008. Big test this week against McCaffrey and No. 7 Stanford, which averages 203.5 rushing yards per game. Whenever quarterback Josh Rosen throws for 300, that’s a good thing for UCLA. Still, Bruins need a few more playmakers to emerge."},{"week":4,"ranking":7,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(2-1) Precipitous fall in the rankings for the Ducks. They have a plethora of running backs, but losing Royce Freeman (leg injury) is a big blow. Reports suggest he could return in a week or two. Still, there are signs of duress in Eugene. The defense is wobbly, new quarterback Dakota Prukop has been solid (748 yards, 6 TDs, 0 INT) but not great, and there’s a potential two-point conversion controversy brewing."},{"week":4,"ranking":8,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(2-1) Buffaloes led 28-21 early in the third quarter at No. 4 Michigan when quarterback Sefo Liufau suffered a right ankle sprain. He played one more series before leaving and Colorado fell apart offensively. Freshman backup QB Steven Montez was 0 for 7 in the 45-28 defeat – Colorado's 23rd straight loss to a ranked team. Liufau listed as day-to-day before Saturday’s Pac-12 opener at Oregon."},{"week":4,"ranking":9,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(2-1) Coach Rich Rodriguez is noncommittal on who will start at quarterback this week against Washington. Anu Solomon has missed the past two games with a knee injury while Brandon Dawkins has taken over and led the Wildcats to a pair of wins. He's completing 62 percent of his throws and has tossed 2 TDs and no interceptions. Running back Nick Harris (ankle) is also questionable."},{"week":4,"ranking":10,"team":"USC","blurb":"(1-2) Saturday’s loss almost certainly knocked the Trojans out of the playoff picture, but they could still finish the season in the Rose Bowl. Both losses have been to top-10 ranked teams. Even though the QB situation is still jumbled, USC has to do a better job of getting the ball to all-conference-caliber receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. He has a combined four catches for 43 receiving yards in both defeats."},{"week":4,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(1-1) Beavers force five turnovers in 37-7 win over FCS team Idaho State. One of the biggest problems for OSU last season was the scarcity of big plays. This season, Beavers have five plays covering at least 30 yards, including a 92-yard rushing TD by receiver Victor Bolden Jr."},{"week":4,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(1-2) With all of the arrests, investigations and accusations of Pullman police targeting WSU players, maybe this is a good week for a bye. Feels like a defining moment in coach Mike Leach’s tenure at WSU. Next three games: Oregon, at Stanford and UCLA."},{"week":5,"ranking":1,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"(3-0) Survive and advance is a winning formula the Cardinal has perfected under coach David Shaw. Other than Heisman Trophy hopeful Christian McCaffrey, Stanford isn’t overly impressive. But that defense could be special. The Cardinal ranks first in the Pac-12 and eighth in the country allowing just 12 points per game."},{"week":5,"ranking":2,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(4-0) The Huskies had flaws exposed in their 35-28 overtime win at Arizona. But they discovered their running game for the first time this season. If unheralded junior running back Lavon Coleman runs for 181 yards again, I'm pretty sure he won’t be on the kickoff team next week. UW is 4-6 all-time in OT games. QB Jake Browning said: “A lot of people talk about what happens when adversity comes to this team, and tonight we showed we could handle that.”"},{"week":5,"ranking":3,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(4-0) Coach Kyle Whittingham gambled and won while converting four fourth-down conversions in last Friday’s 31-27 comeback win over USC. The win came at a potential cost: All-Pac-12 defensive tackle Lowell Lotulelei suffered an apparent shoulder injury and is questionable for Saturday’s game at California – Utah’s first road Pac-12 contest."},{"week":5,"ranking":4,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(4-0) I take back every bad thing I ever wrote about the Sun Devils. Sure, the defense gives up a lot of yards (ranks last in Pac-12 averaging 499) and allows a ton of points (ranks 11th in Pac-12 averaging 34.2), but ASU is an opportunistic bunch. The Sun Devils routinely came up with sack-killing drives and momentum-changing turnovers in Saturday’s 51-41 win vs. Cal. Plus, ASU is 18 for 18 in the red zone."},{"week":5,"ranking":5,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(3-1) Maybe the Buffaloes really are for real. Or maybe they took advantage of a hapless Oregon team during a 41-38 win, which snapped a six-game losing streak to the Ducks. Whatever the case, CU has found another star at junior in Devin Ross, who had seven catches and 153 yards at Oregon. He’s the next great Buffs receiver following Nelson Spruce and Paul Richardson. But Bryce Bobo had the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0d567wp_9E\">catch of the year</a> hauling in a go-ahead TD. No need to rush QB Sefo Liufau (right ankle sprain) back into duty after redshirt freshman Steven Montez accounted for 448 yards total offense last week."},{"week":5,"ranking":6,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(2-2) Tough 22-13 loss in the final minutes against Stanford, which almost certainly knocked the Bruins out of the playoffs. They’re just 0-1 in the Pac-12, but it feels as if they’ve fallen out of the race for the South division, as well. Still, there’s a lot to like about this team. Quarterback Josh Rosen had another solid, if not spectacular, outing and the defense held Stanford and McCaffrey in check. Now if the Bruins could only get the running game going (they rank last in the Pac-12 averaging 117 yards), then they might have something."},{"week":5,"ranking":7,"team":"California","blurb":"(2-2) How in the world do you lose a game when Davis Webb throws for 478 yards and five touchdowns? And yet, that’s exactly what happened at Arizona State. The Golden Bears have scored at least 40 points in every game, but they’re 2-2. And they’re 0-2 when they don’t score 50. That’s not a winning recipe. There hasn’t been a bigger surprise in the Pac-12 than receiver Chad Hansen, who is second in the nation with 656 receiving yards."},{"week":5,"ranking":8,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(2-2) Sound the alarms. There’s serious trouble brewing in Eugene. The Ducks are 2-2 for the second straight season. Last year they won seven of the next eight games to finish 9-4 and salvage the season. Not sure if that’s going to happen this year. The team held a player-only meeting, which is a sign that not everyone is on the same page. Transitioning to a 4-3 defense has been rough. Oregon allows 450 yards per game and 32.5 points. The Ducks are also one of the youngest teams in the Pac-12. They had 11 freshman on the two-deep roster last week."},{"week":5,"ranking":9,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(2-2) The short-handed Wildcats gave Washington everything it could handle and nearly came away with the win. You've got to think they’ll get better when a few injured players return and new QB Brandon Dawkins matures. He’s already pretty good and looks like Colin Kaepernick in his prime. Dawkins had 341 all-purpose yards and two rush TDs against the Huskies. The Cats don’t need injured Anu Solomon, but the return of Nick Wilson is a must, considering his fill-in, J.J. Taylor, suffered a season-ending broken ankle."},{"week":5,"ranking":10,"team":"USC","blurb":"(1-3) The Trojans have played the nation’s toughest schedule, which explains why they’re the only team in the Pac-12 with two losses. But things don’t get any easier with undefeated Arizona State and one-loss Colorado visiting Memorial Stadium the next two weeks. If first-year coach Clay Helton loses both, I'm not sure he’ll make it to Halloween. Can’t ask much more from redshirt freshman QB Sam Darnold, whose debut (253 passing yards last week) was <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/usc/la-sp-usc-football-20160926-snap-story.html\">among the best in Trojans history</a>."},{"week":5,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(1-2) New quarterback Darell Garretson, who did not play in the second half against Boise State due to a leg injury, took all of the first-team reps in practice Tuesday. He told reporters <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/beavers/index.ssf/2016/09/oregon_state_beavers_practice_88.html\">that he feels fine</a>. That’s good news for the Beavers, who travel to Colorado on Saturday."},{"week":5,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(1-2) During their bye week, the Cougars got a win when they found out safety Shalom Luani won’t face charges for his alleged role in an Aug. 24 fight outside a pizza joint. The next four weeks (home against Oregon, at Stanford, home against UCLA and at Arizona State) will go a long way in deciding Washington State’s season. Remember, some Pac-12 observers picked the Cougars as a dark-horse candidate to win the North division."},{"week":6,"ranking":1,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(5-0, 2-0) Perhaps the most complete team in the Pac-12. The Huskies have a bounty of defensive stars, but no one has had a bigger impact than CB Sidney Jones, who practically erases half of the field. The offense has playmakers at quarterback (Jake Browning), running back (Myles Gaskin) and receiver (John Ross III). The offensive line <a href=\"https://www.profootballfocus.com/college-football-washington-stanford-grades/\">received top grades from Pro Football Focus</a> following the blowout win over Stanford. UW coaches won’t allow players to talk the media this week, perhaps a sign the Huskies aren’t used to being the top team in the conference. Still if the Huskies win Saturday against Oregon – and that’s not a given – the season sets up nicely for them. They have a bye next week before finishing with three home (OSU, USC, ASU) and three road games (Utah, Cal, WSU)."},{"week":6,"ranking":2,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"(3-1, 2-1) Short drop in the rankings for the Cardinal after its worst defeat since 2007. The rash of injuries is a major concern. Stanford began last week’s game without four starters and lost three more against Washington. But potentially more alarming is UW may have provided to opponents a blueprint for beating Stanford: Stack the box against star running back Christian McCaffrey and force QB Ryan Burns to throw down field. Stanford averages 149 passing yards per game – the fewest in the Pac-12."},{"week":6,"ranking":3,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(4-1, 2-0) Coach Mike MacIntyre has an interesting decision this week. Stay with red-hot redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Montez, who has 626 yards and six TDs while completing 71.2 percent of his throws during two starts (both wins)? Or return to senior Sefo Luifau, who owns over 80 school records? The Buffs have forced a turnover in 18 straight games, which is the nation’s longest current streak."},{"week":6,"ranking":4,"team":"California","blurb":"(3-2, 1-1) The only team in the Pac-12 that’s beaten two ranked teams. The Golden Bears upset then-No. 11 Texas, 50-43, three weeks ago and knocked off then-No. 18 Utah last Saturday, 28-23. It’s the first time Cal has posted consecutive wins against ranked opponents since 2009. If the Golden Bears can play defense like they did last Saturday – and that’s a big \"if\" – then QB Davis Webb is good enough to carry them to a North division title and potentially a Pac-12 championship."},{"week":6,"ranking":5,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(4-1, 1-1) The Utes are essentially one yard short of remaining perfect. But let’s be honest: Utah has been living dangerously this season. Three of the Utes' past four games have been decided by a combined 10 points. The defense will almost always keep them in every game, but Utah's offense may struggle to keep pace with some of the Pac-12’s high-scoring offenses."},{"week":6,"ranking":6,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(3-2, 1-1) Feels like we might be underselling what may end up being the best team in the Pac-12. A season-opening, 31-24 loss at Texas A&M knocked UCLA out of the College Football Playoff picture and a 22-13 defeat to Stanford in the Pac-12 opener dimmed the Bruins’ forecast. But those were two narrow losses decided in the final minute against ranked teams. QB Josh Rosen, who had 350 yards and four TDs in last Saturday’s 45-24 win over Arizona, is still very good. And RB Nate Starks had his best game (80 yards) of the season. "},{"week":6,"ranking":7,"team":"USC","blurb":"(2-3, 1-2) The Trojans are another Los Angeles-based team that could prove to be a sleeping giant. In his second start – and this time he had a full week to prepare – freshman QB Sam Darnold looked like the real deal. He finished with 352 passing yards and three TDs in USC’s 41-20 must-win over Arizona State. Two other equally important developments: The Trojans rediscovered star WR JuJu Smith-Schuster; he had 15 catches for 221 yards and three TDs during the past two games with Darnold. (Smith-Schuster had 11 grabs for 99 yards and two TDs in the previous three contests.) And USC’s defense had three sacks last week, which snapped a two-game sackless streak."},{"week":6,"ranking":8,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(4-1, 1-1) Even before QB Manny Wilkins was knocked out of Saturday’s loss at USC with an apparent leg injury, the Sun Devils were trailing 27-6 just minutes before halftime. He left the game in a walking boot, but X-rays didn’t reveal a serious injury. Still, he probably won’t play this week, which forces ASU to rely on redshirt freshman Brady White, who lost the job in the fall to Wilkins. The Sun Devils also need to solve problems in the secondary. ASU ranks last in the nation allowing 396.4 passing yards. The Sun Devils have allowed 17 passing TDs."},{"week":6,"ranking":9,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(2-2, 1-0) Thumping Oregon 51-33 certainly put the rest of the Pac-12 on notice. The Cougars can put points on the scoreboard. Gabe Marks (29 catches for 262 yards) and Travis Martin Jr. (24 for 257) might be the best receiving duo in the Pac-12. They're among the top five in the conference in receptions. And QB Luke Falk (12 TDs and two INTs) has routinely made big plays, while avoiding critical mistakes. It remains to be see if the Cougars can stop a quality offense. WSU has just four sacks – the lowest in the Pac-12 – and surrenders 294 passing yards per game."},{"week":6,"ranking":10,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(2-3, 0-2) Last week’s players-only meeting didn’t stop the losing. After the Ducks' latest setback, coach Mark Helfrich fired off <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoachHelfrich/status/782789270431932417\">a motivational tweet</a>. That’s what happens when you lose three straight for the first time since 2007. There are all sorts of problems in Eugene. It starts with the defense that gives up 36.2 points and 490.4 yards per game – both ranked 11th in the Pac-12. It extends to a pervasive lack of discipline from a team that leads the conference with 45 penalties. And it culminates with a new QB, Dakota Prukop, who had his worst outing (132 passing yards) last week."},{"week":6,"ranking":11,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(2-3, 0-2) The Wildcats are running out of healthy bodies in their offensive backfield. At the end of a 45-24 loss at UCLA, Arizona was down to its fourth-string QB. Freshman Khalil Tate was pressed into duty because walk-on QB Zach Werlinger was ineffective after Brandon Dawkins (ribs) was knocked out and Anu Solomon (knee) stayed home. RB Nick Wilson, who returned after missing last week, apparently re-injured his left ankle and is questionable for the next game."},{"week":6,"ranking":12,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(1-3, 0-1) For the second straight week, the Beavers pulled ineffective quarterback Darrell Garretson in favor of Conor Blount. However, the freshman walk-on hasn’t provided a spark. But don’t blame Garretson and Blount for all of OSU’s trouble. The offensive line has allowed 17 sacks – the most in the Pac-12. And aside from WR Seth Collins (21 catches for 241 yards), there aren’t any offensive threats. Plus, the defense isn’t nearly good enough to overcome the instability at QB. If the Beavers don’t beat Arizona on Nov. 19, they’ll likely finish without a Pac-12 win."}];
