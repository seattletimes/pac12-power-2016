But then the offense sputtered and had four straight punts and a fumble on first five possessions in second half and managed just one touchdown after the break. Still, the defense (eight sacks and two turnovers) and Christian McCaffrey (210 all-purpose yards) bailed out Stanford for a 26-13 win over Kansas State."},{"week":2,"ranking":2,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(1-0) John Ross III for Heisman? Too soon? Maybe so. But the junior receiver/kick returner certainly opened some eyes across the country with a three-touchdown performance (38-yard and 50-yard receptions and 92-yard kickoff return) in his first game back from knee surgeries that forced him to miss 2015. The Huskies are averaging 48.3 points in past three games."},{"week":2,"ranking":3,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(1-0) Looks like it’s going to take Brady Hoke a little longer to revamp a Ducks defense that gave up nearly 400 yards and 28 points at home to a UC Davis team that ranked 11th in scoring and last in yards in the FCS Big Sky last year. Still, freshman linebacker Troy Dye had 11 tackles, including 4.5 for loss en route to winning the conference Defensive Player of the Week honors."},{"week":2,"ranking":4,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(1-0) Utes now own the longest current sellout streak in Pac-12 with 39 straight capacity crowds at Rice-Eccles Stadium. The place will be packed Saturday when in-state rival Brigham Young visits. Utah has a five-game win streak against the Cougars."},{"week":2,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(1-0) Sun Devils make the biggest jump in this week’s rankings (six spots up). Still not sold on Manny Wilkins as a pocket passer, but he’s one heck of a runner who made the highlights with an air-defying hurdle over a defender last week. He had 180 passing yards on 20 of 27 attempts and 89 yards rushing on 14 carries."},{"week":2,"ranking":6,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(0-1) Josh Rosen did some nice things in season opener, but his three interceptions played a large role in the 31-24 loss at Texas A&M. The turnovers are troubling, but the more pressing issue is shoring up an offensive line that allowed five sacks."},{"week":2,"ranking":7,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(1-0) Buffaloes looked impressive last week’s 44-7 romp over Colorado State. It was easily the most-lopsided win against a FBS team in coach Mike MacIntyre’s four-year tenure. There’s plenty to like about Colorado starting with former Bellarmine Prep standout Sefo Liufau who became the school’s all-time passing leader with 7,715 yards."},{"week":2,"ranking":8,"team":"California","blurb":"(1-0) Maybe you forgot about the Golden Bears who opened the season Aug. 27 in Sydney, Australia and had a bye last week. Good thing too because Hawaii, which lost 51-31 to in the opener, got smashed 63-3 at Michigan last week. Cal has had plenty of time to get ready for a tough trip to San Diego State."},{"week":2,"ranking":9,"team":"USC","blurb":"(0-1) Absolutely love the moxie it takes to play No. 1 ranked and defending champion Alabama in Dallas. But you have to show up. Trojans’ 52-6 beatdown is worse loss since 1966 and fourth most lopsided loss in history. USC failed to score a touchdown for first time since 2007."},{"week":2,"ranking":10,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(0-1) It’s such low bar in Corvallis, Ore. considering Beaver fans are strangely optimistic after a 30-23 loss at Minnesota. The reason for that optimism is quarterback Darell Garretson, a transfer from Utah State, who threw for 228 yards and three touchdowns."},{"week":2,"ranking":11,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(0-1) Junior quarterback Anu Solomon might miss Saturday’s home opener with an ankle injury. Even if he plays, he won’t keep the job for long with another performance like last week’s 213-yard and two-interception outing in an 18-16 loss to Brigham Young. If the Wildcats can’t generate get the offense going, expect to see Brandon Dawkins."},{"week":2,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(0-1) Here we go again. Maybe last week’s 45-42 defeat to Eastern Washington is a good omen. Last year, the Cougars lost to FCS division Portland State in the opener and finished 9-4 – its best record since 2003."},{"week":3,"ranking":1,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(2-0) Remember when the passing game was the weakest link for the Huskies? Not this season. At least, not against two over-matched opponents. Jake Browning had 16 passing touchdown in 12 games last year. He already has eight this season (including a bowl game) and is on pace to finish with 52. UW’s defensive starters have surrendered just three points in the first half."},{"week":3,"ranking":2,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"(1-0) Can’t imagine any team in the country has a more difficult schedule (vs. USC, at UCLA, at Washington, vs. Washington State and at Notre Dame) over the next five weeks than the Cardinal. Last week: Bye. "},{"week":3,"ranking":3,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(2-0) In his last outing, Royce Freeman ripped off an 85-yard touchdown run and tallied 207 rushing yards for his 18th 100-yard rushing performance since 2014 – the most for a player from a Power 5 Conference player. He has rushed for at least 100 yards in 10 straight games against FBS opponents."},{"week":3,"ranking":4,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(2-0) The Utes have a special defense, but there’s no way they win another game when the offense commits six turnovers. Quarterback Troy Williams tossed three interceptions and Utah committed six fumbles, losing three."},{"week":3,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(2-0) Can Kalen Ballage play defense? Seriously, the Sun Devils need help stopping people. They rank last in the Pac-12 allowing 518.5 yards per game. Can’t expect Ballage to bail them out each week. Still, he had a special day last Saturday. Ballage had 15 touches and found the end zone eight times to tie a NCAA record with the most touchdowns and points in a game. He scored seven touchdowns on runs of 75, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1 and 1, plus a 39-yard reception. Ballage had 207 all-purpose yards, including 137 rushing. He has nine touchdowns this season, which is more than Stanford (3), Oregon State (3), Utah (5), USC (6), Arizona (6) and UCLA (8)."},{"week":3,"ranking":6,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(2-0) The Buffaloes have scored 100 combined points in the past two games, which is more than they had in the past six games in 2015. Quarterback Sefo Liufau was very efficient with 15-of-18 passing for 204 yards and two TD passes against Idaho State."},{"week":3,"ranking":7,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(1-1) The Bruins rebounded from a tough road loss in the opener at Texas A&M with a satisfying – if not always consistent – 21-point win over UNLV. Josh Rosen threw for 267 yards and one touchdown and rushed for one score. "},{"week":3,"ranking":8,"team":"USC","blurb":"(1-1) Not sure if the Trojans have settled on a quarterback. Max Browne started and tossed two touchdown passes, but backup Sam Darnold also had two TD throws against Utah State. The Trojans also received big games from Adoree Jackson (77-yard punt return for a TD) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (2 TD catches)."},{"week":3,"ranking":9,"team":"California","blurb":"(1-1) New quarterback Davis Webb tossed five TD passes and 522 yards, but sailed a pass high in the final minutes that might have capped an improbable comeback. Still, the Golden Bears lost this game because of its inability to stop Donnel Pumphrey who ran for 3 TDS and 281 yards to break Marshall Faulk’s school record."},{"week":3,"ranking":10,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(1-1) The Wildcats were a 44-point favorite, but trailed 21-7 at halftime against Grambling State. Arizona used a 21-point third quarter to take control of the game. Will be interesting to see if Anu Solomon who sat out due to a knee injury, will start again after his replacement Brandon Dawkins led the comeback with 320 all-purpose yards, 223 passing and 97 rushing."},{"week":3,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(0-1) The Beavers had an extra week to get ready for Idaho State, which lost by 49 points at Colorado. Should be a fun home opener at Reser Stadium on Saturday. "},{"week":3,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(0-2) Second straight week at that bottom of the rankings, which is no way to start a season. Coach Mike Leach was 2-for-5 on fourth-down conversions, which played a big role in Saturday’s loss at Boise State. Questionable clock management in the final minute also undermined a late comeback effort."},{"week":4,"ranking":1,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"(2-0) As if we needed a reminder, but Christian McCaffrey is pretty doggone good. After a week off, the do-everything star accounted for 260 all-purpose yards and 2 TDs in last week’s 27-10 dismantling of USC, which also re-launched his Heisman Trophy campaign."},{"week":4,"ranking":2,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(3-0) The Huskies’ offensive success begins and ends with Jake Browning, who has 744 passing yards, 12 touchdowns and one interception while completing 72 percent of his throws. The Huskies have outscored opponents 148 to 30.

There’s serious trouble brewing in Eugene. The Ducks are 2-2 for the second straight season. Last year they won seven of the next eight games to finish 9-4 and salvage the season. Not sure if that’s going to happen this year. The team held a player-only meeting, which is a sign that not everyone is on the same page. Transitioning to a 4-3 defense has been rough. Oregon allows 450 yards per game and 32.5 points. The Ducks are also one of the youngest teams in the Pac-12. They had 11 freshman on the two-deep roster last week."},{"week":5,"ranking":9,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(2-2) The short-handed Wildcats gave Washington everything it could handle and nearly came away with the win. You've got to think they’ll get better when a few injured players return and new QB Brandon Dawkins matures. He’s already pretty good and looks like Colin Kaepernick in his prime. Dawkins had 341 all-purpose yards and two rush TDs against the Huskies. The Cats don’t need injured Anu Solomon, but the return of Nick Wilson is a must, considering his fill-in, J.J.

Stanford averages 149 passing yards per game – the fewest in the Pac-12."},{"week":6,"ranking":3,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(4-1, 2-0) Coach Mike MacIntyre has an interesting decision this week. Stay with red-hot redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Montez, who has 626 yards and six TDs while completing 71.2 percent of his throws during two starts (both wins)?

It’s the first time Cal has posted consecutive wins against ranked opponents since 2009.

A season-opening, 31-24 loss at Texas A&M knocked UCLA out of the College Football Playoff picture and a 22-13 defeat to Stanford in the Pac-12 opener dimmed the Bruins’ forecast. But those were two narrow losses decided in the final minute against ranked teams. QB Josh Rosen, who had 350 yards and four TDs in last Saturday’s 45-24 win over Arizona, is still very good.

Two other equally important developments: The Trojans rediscovered star WR JuJu Smith-Schuster; he had 15 catches for 221 yards and three TDs during the past two games with Darnold.

They're among the top five in the conference in receptions. And QB Luke Falk (12 TDs and two INTs) has routinely made big plays, while avoiding critical mistakes.

That’s a lot of missing pieces for the battered Beavers, who struggle to mount a decent passing attack when they’re healthy.<br/><strong>Next up:</strong> At Washington."},{"week":8,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(2-4, 0-3) Halfway through the season and the Ducks have already had a slew of injuries, their first four-game losing streak in 20 years, a change at quarterback, an apology from the coach to fans, a lukewarm endorsement from the athletic director to the coach, and an admission from a player that about one-third of the team doesn’t care if Oregon wins. That’s a lot to deal with for a program that hasn’t faced a lot of adversity in recent years.<br/><strong>Next up:</strong> At California."},{"week":8,"ranking":12,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(2-5, 0-4) The Wildcats are down to their fourth-string quarterback (Khalil Tate) and fourth-string running back (Zach Green) following fourth straight loss. Great time for a week off.<br/><strong>Next up:</strong> Bye."},{"week":9,"ranking":1,"team":"Washington","blurb":"(7-0, 4-0) Jake Browning’s Heisman Trophy pursuit garners the headlines, but a significant untold story of the Huskies is the re-emergence of their running game. RB Myles Gaskin had a sluggish start against a couple of underwhelming nonconference opponents in which he gained 124 rushing yards total, but lately he’s been on a tear. Gaskin is averaging 142 in the past three games. He has 727 yards this season, which is second best in the Pac-12.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> At No. 17 Utah."},{"week":9,"ranking":2,"team":"Utah","blurb":"(7-1, 4-1) And speaking of running backs, Joe Williams is living a fairy tale dream. He quit football after Week 2 and missed four games before returning better than ever. He had 179 rushing yards two weeks ago and followed that with a school-record 332 last Saturday against UCLA. You can’t make this stuff up.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> Against No. 4 Washington."},{"week":9,"ranking":3,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"(5-2, 4-0) Postgame coaches’ handshakes and press conferences have suddenly become must-see TV for coach Mike Leach. Meanwhile, the next three opponents (Oregon State, Arizona and California) have a combined 8-13 record. The Cougars should run their winning streak to eight straight victories before ending the season at No. 23 Colorado and against No. 4 Washington.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> At Oregon State."},{"week":9,"ranking":4,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"(6-2, 4-1) The 23rd-ranked Buffaloes <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/huskies-rise-to-no-4-in-ap-poll-open-as-an-11-point-favorite-vs-no-17-utah/\">returned to the AP top-25 rankings</a> this week following a gritty 10-5 win at Stanford. They became the third Pac-12 team to become bowl eligible, which guarantees the Buffs their first postseason trip since 2007. Now they’re gunning for a Pac-12 South title, which could be decided in the Nov. 26 regular-season finale against No. 17 Utah.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> Bye."},{"week":9,"ranking":5,"team":"USC","blurb":"(4-3, 4-2) During their bye, the Trojans lost DE Jabari Ruffin (suspension) and RB Justin Davis (ankle sprain), their leading rusher. They need WR JuJu Smith-Schuster (back) to return healthy if they’re to make a second-half push for the Pac-12 South title. USC, which beat Colorado and lost to Utah, has four conference games (Cal, Oregon, UW and UCLA) remaining and needs help to repeat as division champions.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> Against California."},{"week":9,"ranking":6,"team":"California","blurb":"(4-3, 2-2) The Golden Bears need two more wins to become bowl eligible, but it won’t be easy. Their remaining schedule: at USC, against Washington, at Washington State and at home against Stanford and UCLA. QB Davis Webb has been brilliant directing the “Bear Raid” offense that’s sixth nationally averaging 545 yards per game. But he can’t continue to cover up a woeful defense that allows 41.3 points per game – 124th among 128 FBS teams.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> At USC."},{"week":9,"ranking":7,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"(4-3, 2-3) The Cardinal has scored only one offensive touchdown outside of garbage time in the past four games. Stanford averages 17 points per game, which ranks 126th nationally. The top playmakers returned from an offense that led the Pac-12 with a 40.9-point scoring average last season. The problem has been inconsistent play at quarterback and on the offensive line. The silver lining for Stanford is the upcoming schedule is much easier; the combined record of its final five opponents is 11-24.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> At Arizona."},{"week":9,"ranking":8,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"(5-3, 2-3) The Sun Devils have much bigger issues than the feud between coach Todd Graham and WSU’s Mike Leach. They have to figure out who is going to be their quarterback next week. Manny Wilkins suffered an apparent right arm injury that knocked him out of last Saturday’s loss to the Cougars early in the first quarter. ASU was forced to turn to its fourth option, freshman Dillon Sterling-Cole, who finished with 86 yards on 7-for-16 passing.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> At Oregon."},{"week":9,"ranking":9,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"(3-5, 1-4) The Bruins’ six-year bowl streak is in jeopardy. They need to go 3-1 over the final four games against No. 23 Colorado, Oregon State, USC and California. It’s possible, but QB Josh Rosen (right shoulder) could miss a couple more games and you can’t expect backup Mike Fafaul to pass for 464 yards again. Last week coach Jim Mora vowed to fix the running game and the Bruins managed just 46 yards on the ground against Utah.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> Bye."},{"week":9,"ranking":10,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"(2-5, 1-3) There’s no quit in the Beavers though injuries have decimated the offense, which is averaging 15.5 points in the past two games. That’s a big dropoff for a team that scored 47 three weeks ago against California. OSU needs two more wins to avoid its worst two-season stretch since Jerry Pettibone (2-9) and Mike Riley (3-8) combined for five wins in 1996 and 1997.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> Against Washington State."},{"week":9,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"(2-5, 0-4) Got to wonder if new defensive coordinator Brady Hoke will be fired after the season or earlier. The Ducks ranked last in the Pac-12 last year in defensive scoring (37.5 points per game) and yards allowed (485.3 per game). This year they’ve gotten worse, still ranking last in the Pac-12 in defensive scoring (43.3) and yards allowed (538.6). On the bright side, new freshman QB Justin Herbert displayed tremendous growth (six TDs) in his second start.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> Against Arizona State."},{"week":9,"ranking":12,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"(2-5, 0-4) Veteran QB Brandon Dawkins (concussion/ribs) and Anu Solomon (knee) practiced during the bye week, which is good news. RB Nick Wilson (knee) is expected to miss a few more games, which is bad news because the Wildcats have just one healthy running back. In its five losses, Arizona is minus-11, including minus-7 the past two games.<br/><strong>Next week:</strong> Against Stanford."}];
