But then the offense sputtered and had four straight punts and a fumble on first five possessions in second half and managed just one touchdown after the break. Still, the defense (eight sacks and two turnovers) and Christian McCaffrey (210 all-purpose yards) bailed out Stanford for a 26-13 win over Kansas State."},{"week":2,"ranking":2,"team":"Washington","blurb":"John Ross III for Heisman? Too soon? Maybe so. But the junior receiver/kick returner certainly opened some eyes across the country with a three-touchdown performance (38-yard and 50-yard receptions and 92-yard kickoff return) in his first game back from knee surgeries that forced him to miss 2015. The Huskies are averaging 48.3 points in past three games."},{"week":2,"ranking":3,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"Looks like it’s going to take Brady Hoke a little longer to revamp a Ducks defense that gave up nearly 400 yards and 28 points at home to a UC Davis team that ranked 11th in scoring and last in yards in the FCS Big Sky last year. Still, freshman linebacker Troy Dye had 11 tackles, including 4.5 for loss en route to winning the conference Defensive Player of the Week honors."},{"week":2,"ranking":4,"team":"Utah","blurb":"Utes now own the longest current sellout streak in Pac-12 with 39 straight capacity crowds at Rice-Eccles Stadium. The place will be packed Saturday when in-state rival Brigham Young visits. Utah has a five-game win streak against the Cougars."},{"week":2,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"Sun Devils make the biggest jump in this week’s rankings (six spots up). Still not sold on Manny Wilkins as a pocket passer, but he’s one heck of a runner who made the highlights with an air-defying hurdle over a defender last week. He had 180 passing yards on 20 of 27 attempts and 89 yards rushing on 14 carries."},{"week":2,"ranking":6,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"Josh Rosen did some nice things in season opener, but his three interceptions played a large role in the 31-24 loss at Texas A&M. The turnovers are troubling, but the more pressing issue is shoring up an offensive line that allowed five sacks."},{"week":2,"ranking":7,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"Buffaloes looked impressive last week’s 44-7 romp over Colorado State. It was easily the most-lopsided win against a FBS team in coach Mike MacIntyre’s four-year tenure. There’s plenty to like about Colorado starting with former Bellarmine Prep standout Sefo Liufau who became the school’s all-time passing leader with 7,715 yards."},{"week":2,"ranking":8,"team":"California","blurb":"Maybe you forgot about the Golden Bears who opened the season Aug. 27 in Sydney, Australia and had a bye last week. Good thing too because Hawaii, which lost 51-31 to in the opener, got smashed 63-3 at Michigan last week. Cal has had plenty of time to get ready for a tough trip to San Diego State."},{"week":2,"ranking":9,"team":"USC","blurb":"Absolutely love the moxie it takes to play No. 1 ranked and defending champion Alabama in Dallas. But you have to show up. Trojans’ 52-6 beatdown is worse loss since 1966 and fourth most lopsided loss in history. USC failed to score a touchdown for first time since 2007."},{"week":2,"ranking":10,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"It’s such low bar in Corvallis, Ore. considering Beaver fans are strangely optimistic after a 30-23 loss at Minnesota. The reason for that optimism is quarterback Darell Garretson, a transfer from Utah State, who threw for 228 yards and three touchdowns."},{"week":2,"ranking":11,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"Junior quarterback Anu Solomon might miss Saturday’s home opener with an ankle injury. Even if he plays, he won’t keep the job for long with another performance like last week’s 213-yard and two-interception outing in an 18-16 loss to Brigham Young. If the Wildcats can’t generate get the offense going, expect to see Brandon Dawkins."},{"week":2,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"Here we go again. Maybe last week’s 45-42 defeat to Eastern Washington is a good omen. Last year, the Cougars lost to FCS division Portland State in the opener and finished 9-4 – its best record since 2003."},{"week":3,"ranking":1,"team":"Washington","blurb":"Remember when the passing game was the weakest link for the Huskies? Not this season. At least, not against two over-matched opponents. Jake Browning had 16 passing touchdown in 12 games last year. He already has eight this season (including a bowl game) and is on pace to finish with 52. UW’s defensive starters have surrendered just three points in the first half."},{"week":3,"ranking":2,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"Can’t imagine any team in the country has a more difficult schedule (vs. USC, at UCLA, at Washington, vs. Washington State and at Notre Dame) over the next five weeks than the Cardinal. Last week: Bye. "},{"week":3,"ranking":3,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"In his last outing, Royce Freeman ripped off an 85-yard touchdown run and tallied 207 rushing yards for his 18th 100-yard rushing performance since 2014 – the most for a player from a Power 5 Conference player. He has rushed for at least 100 yards in 10 straight games against FBS opponents."},{"week":3,"ranking":4,"team":"Utah","blurb":"The Utes have a special defense, but there’s no way they win another game when the offense commits six turnovers. Quarterback Troy Williams tossed three interceptions and Utah committed six fumbles, losing three."},{"week":3,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"Can Kalen Ballage play defense? Seriously, the Sun Devils need help stopping people. They rank last in the Pac-12 allowing 518.5 yards per game. Can’t expect Ballage to bail them out each week. Still, he had a special day last Saturday. Ballage had 15 touches and found the end zone eight times to tie a NCAA record with the most touchdowns and points in a game. He scored seven touchdowns on runs of 75, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1 and 1, plus a 39-yard reception. Ballage had 207 all-purpose yards, including 137 rushing. He has nine touchdowns this season, which is more than Stanford (3), Oregon State (3), Utah (5), USC (6), Arizona (6) and UCLA (8)."},{"week":3,"ranking":6,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"The Buffaloes have scored 100 combined points in the past two games, which is more than they had in the past six games in 2015. Quarterback Sefo Liufau was very efficient with 15-of-18 passing for 204 yards and two TD passes against Idaho State."},{"week":3,"ranking":7,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"The Bruins rebounded from a tough road loss in the opener at Texas A&M with a satisfying – if not always consistent – 21-point win over UNLV. Josh Rosen threw for 267 yards and one touchdown and rushed for one score. "},{"week":3,"ranking":8,"team":"USC","blurb":"Not sure if the Trojans have settled on a quarterback. Max Browne started and tossed two touchdown passes, but backup Sam Darnold also had two TD throws against Utah State. The Trojans also received big games from Adoree Jackson (77-yard punt return for a TD) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (2 TD catches)."},{"week":3,"ranking":9,"team":"California","blurb":"New quarterback Davis Webb tossed five TD passes and 522 yards, but sailed a pass high in the final minutes that might have capped an improbable comeback. Still, the Golden Bears lost this game because of its inability to stop Donnel Pumphrey who ran for 3 TDS and 281 yards to break Marshall Faulk’s school record."},{"week":3,"ranking":10,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"The Wildcats were a 44-point favorite, but trailed 21-7 at halftime against Grambling State. Arizona used a 21-point third quarter to take control of the game. Will be interesting to see if Anu Solomon who sat out due to a knee injury, will start again after his replacement Brandon Dawkins led the comeback with 320 all-purpose yards, 223 passing and 97 rushing."},{"week":3,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"The Beavers had an extra week to get ready for Idaho State, which lost by 49 points at Colorado. Should be a fun home opener at Reser Stadium on Saturday. "},{"week":3,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"Second straight week at that bottom of the rankings, which is no way to start a season. Coach Mike Leach was 2-for-5 on fourth-down conversions, which played a big role in Saturday’s loss at Boise State. Questionable clock management in the final minute also undermined a late comeback effort."},{"week":4,"ranking":1,"team":"Stanford","blurb":"As if we needed a reminder, but Christian McCaffrey is pretty doggone good. After a week off, the do-everything star accounted for 260 all-purpose yards and 2 TDs in last week’s 27-10 dismantlign of UCS,, which also re-launched his Heisman Trophy campaign."},{"week":4,"ranking":2,"team":"Washington","blurb":"The Huskies’ offensive success begins and ends with Jack Browning who has 744 passing yards, 12 touchdowns and one interception while completing 72 percent of his throws. The Huskies have outscored opponents 148 to 30. UW has scored at least 40 points in the past six games."},{"week":4,"ranking":3,"team":"Utah","blurb":"The Utes debuted at No. 24 this week in the Associated Press top 25. They racked up 10 sacks during last week’s 34-17 win at San Jose State. Senior WR Tim Patrick has given Utah a vertical threat to the passing game. He has leads 19th in the nation with 285 receiving yards on 14 receptions. Patrick also has all four of Utah’s receiving TDs."},{"week":4,"ranking":4,"team":"California","blurb":"The Golden Bears make the biggest jump in this week’s rankings moving up five spots. Not sure if there’s a Pac-12 quarterback playing better than newcomer Davis Webb. The Texas Tech transfer orchestrated a 50-43 upset win over then-No. 11 Texas with a 396-yard, 4-TD performance."},{"week":4,"ranking":5,"team":"Arizona State","blurb":"It hasn’t always been pretty, but the Sun Devils are undefeated. ASU’s pass defense ranks last among the 128 Division I schools allowing 379.3 yards per game. That might be a problem this week against California, which is second in the nation averaging 453 passing yards per game."},{"week":4,"ranking":6,"team":"UCLA","blurb":"Held BYU to 23 rushing yards, which his the lowest for a Bruins opponent since 2008. Big test this week against McCaffrey and No. 7 Stanford, which averages 203.5 rushing yards per game. Whenever quarterback Josh Rosen throws for 300 that’s a good thing for UCLA. Still, Bruins need a few more playmakers to emerge."},{"week":4,"ranking":7,"team":"Oregon","blurb":"Precipitous fall in the rankings for the Ducks. They have a plethora of running backs, but losing Royce Freeman (leg injury) is a big blow. Reports suggest he could return in a week or two. Still, there are signs of duress in Eugene. The defense is wobbly, new quarterback Dakota Prukop has been solid (748 yards, 6 TDs, 0 INT) but not great and there’s a potential two-point conversion controversy brewing."},{"week":4,"ranking":8,"team":"Colorado","blurb":"Buffaloes led 28-21 early in the third quarter at No. 4 Michigan when quarterback Sefo Liufau suffered a right ankle sprain. He played one more series before leaving and Colorado fell apart offensively. Freshman backup QB Steven Montez was 0 for 7 in the 45-28 defeat – their 23rd straight loss to a ranked team. Liufau listed as day-to-day before Saturday’s Pac-12 opener at Oregon."},{"week":4,"ranking":9,"team":"Arizona","blurb":"Coach Rich Rodriguez is noncommittal on who will start at quarterback this week against Washington. Anu Solomon has missed the past two games with a knee injury while Brandon Dawkins has taken over and led the Wildcats to a pair of wins. He completing 62 percent of his throws and has tossed 2 TDs and no interceptions. Running back Nick Harris (ankle) is also questionable."},{"week":4,"ranking":10,"team":"USC","blurb":"Saturday’s loss almost certainly knocked the Trojans out of the playoff picture, but they could still finish the season in the Rose Bowl. Both losses have been to top-10 ranked teams. Even though the QB situation is still jumbled, USC has to do a better job of getting the ball to all-conference caliber receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. He has a combined four catches for 43 receiving yards in both defeats."},{"week":4,"ranking":11,"team":"Oregon State","blurb":"Beavers force five turnovers in 37-7 loss over FCS team Idaho State. One of the biggest problems for OSU last season was the scarcity of big plays. This season, Beavers have five plays covering at least 30 yards, including a 92-yard rushing TD by receiver Victor Bolden Jr."},{"week":4,"ranking":12,"team":"Washington State","blurb":"With all of the arrests, investigations and accusations of Pullman police targeting WSU players, maybe this is a good week for a bye. Feels like a defining moment in coach Mike Leach’s tenure at WSU. Next three games: Oregon, at Stanford and UCLA."}];
